# MangaDownloader

## What is it all about?
A simple HTML parser of common websites that distribute manga 
that downloads the images to your computer.

## Why?
Because there are a lot of people out there that prefer to read the files using
their favorite Manga Viewer and not read them online and others that want to do
it offline.

## How to use?
This is a python application, so you will need to have python installed.

```
./MangaDownloader <manga_url>
```

Where <manga_url> is the website of the manga. For example: `http://www.mangareader.net/93/naruto.html`

You can see all the available options by executing `./MangaDownloader --help`
