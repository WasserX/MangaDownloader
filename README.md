# MangaDownloader

## What is it all about?
A simple HTML parser of common websites that distribute manga 
that downloads the images to your computer.

## Why?
Because there are a lot of people out there that prefer to read the files using
their favorite Manga Viewer and not read them online and others that want to do
it offline.

## Requirements
This application depends on python 2.7

## How to use?

```
./MangaDownloader <manga_url>
```

Where `<manga_url>` is the website of the manga, 
for example: `http://www.mangareader.net/93/naruto.html`

You can see all available options with `./MangaDownloader --help`
