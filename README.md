# MangaDownloader

## What is it all about?
A simple HTML parser of common websites that distribute manga 
that downloads the images to your computer.

## Why?
Because there are a lot of people out there that prefer to read the files using
their favorite Manga Viewer and not read them on the browser and others that 
can't be online to read them.

## Requirements
This application depends on python 2.7

## How to use?

```
./MangaDownloader <manga_url>
```

Where `<manga_url>` is the website of the manga, 
for example: `http://www.mangareader.net/93/naruto.html`

You can see all available options with `./MangaDownloader --help`
